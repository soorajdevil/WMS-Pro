Abstract

A warehouse management system is a software application that helps to control and manage the day-to-day operations in a warehouse. Warehouse management system 
can control a manually operated warehouse run by paper or radiofrequency devices, a mixed warehouse, or a large, automated warehouse with the same efficiency. The 
Warehouse management system can be a standalone application or part of an ERP system. The major role of WMS is to help users manage the fulfillment, shipping, 
receiving tasks in the warehouse or distribution centre, such as picking goods for shipment or putting goods away. It is a real time Warehouse database capable of handling 
large inventories of an organization. This can be used to track the inventory of a single store or manage the distribution of stock btw several stores of a large franchise. However, 
the system merely records sales and restocking data and provides notification of low stock at any location at a specified interval. Warehouse management system designed to 
help businesses coordinate administrative activities across distribution centres to optimize order fulfillment, delivery, logistics, and inventory replenishment, among other processes.
